== Description ==

Redirects all HTTPS traffic to HTTP, except for specific exceptions. You might want to do this to minimize the number of times users would see an error if you don't have a valid SSL certificate setup, or if you want to make sure that the delay SSL adds is only experienced when necessary.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'force-non-ssl' directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the General Settings page and add any pages you want to leave HTTPS. See the FAQ for details.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Go to the General Settings page
* Enter each page slug on its own line
	* You can also enter a single word to match any slugs containing that word. E.g., 'cat' would match '/people/cathryn' and '/cats-and-dogs'
